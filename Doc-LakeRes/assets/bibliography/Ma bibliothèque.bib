  abstract = {The assessment of effective hydraulic properties at the catchment scale, i.e., hydraulic conductivity (K) and transmissivity (T), is particularly challenging due to the sparse availability of hydrological monitoring systems through stream gauges and boreholes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a calibration methodology which only considers information from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the spatial distribution of the stream network. The methodology is built on the assumption that the groundwater system is the main driver controlling the stream density and extension, where the perennial stream network reflects the intersection of the groundwater table with the topography. Indeed, the groundwater seepage at the surface is primarily controlled by the topography, the aquifer thickness and the dimensionless parameter K/R, where R is the average recharge rate. Here, we use a process-based and parsimonious 3D groundwater flow model to calibrate K/R by minimizing the relative distances between the observed and the simulated stream network generated from groundwater seepage zones. By deploying the methodology in 24 selected headwater catchments located in northwestern France, we demonstrate that the method successfully predicts the stream network extent for 80 \% of the cases. Results show a high sensitivity of K/R to the extension of the low-order streams and limited impacts of the DEM resolution as long the DEM remains consistent with the stream network observations. By assuming an average recharge rate, we found that effective K values vary between 1.0×10-5 and 1.1×10-4 m s−1, in agreement with local estimates derived from hydraulic tests and independent calibrated groundwater model. With the emergence of global remote-sensing databases compiling information on high-resolution DEM and stream networks, this approach provides new opportunities to assess hydraulic properties of unconfined aquifers in ungauged basins.},

  abstract = {Le bassin rennais n’est pas épargné par le changement climatique. Des conditions climatiques inhabituelles fragilisent déjà le système d’alimentation en eau potable du territoire. Mais qu’en sera-t-il dans le futur ? Les gestionnaires d’Eau du Bassin Rennais ont besoin d’outils pour se projeter dans les évolutions possibles des ressources en eau en amont des ouvrages de captages. Pour y répondre, nous avons développé une démarche de modélisation hydro(géo)logique à l’échelle du bassin versant, adaptée au contexte géologique de socle en Bretagne intégrant les déterminants majeurs que sont les relations entre la nappe d’eau souterraine et les cours d’eau. Nous avons proposé une innovante méthode de calibration des propriétés de la subsurface à partir d’observations du réseau hydrographique. L’approche de modélisation d’écoulement de l’eau souterraine mise en œuvre est basée sur les processus hydrogéologiques. Elle est en mesure de reproduire correctement l’intermittence des cours d’eau, indicateur de la résilience des bassins versants. Une fois calibrés, les modèles sont soumis à de multiples projections climatiques, selon différents scénarios d’émission de gaz à effet de serre (RCP), pour la période 1980 à 2100. Les simulations réalisées fournissent une enveloppe de trajectoires d’évolution du stock d’eau souterraine, du débit des cours d’eau et de l’intermittence du réseau hydrographique en tête de bassin versant. Les projections montrent une extension des périodes de déficit en eau, avec une occurrence accrue d’années de sécheresses consécutives. En conséquence, les retenues d’eau ont des taux de remplissage plus faibles, les assecs sont plus fréquents et les débits d’étiage en amont des stations de rejet d’eaux traitées peuvent se révéler insuffisants sur des périodes qui s’allongent. Les connaissances apportées et les outils opérationnels développés permettent, d’une part, de progresser sur des questions de recherches en plein essor et, d’autre part, d’offrir de nouvelles perspectives d’anticipation de la disponibilité des ressources pour envisager des stratégies de gestion adaptées en amont des changements à venir.},

We analyze the influence of technical factors (measurement method, scale effects, preferential sampling, and hydraulic anisotropy) and geological factors (lithology, current stress regime, current seismotectonic activity, and long‐term tectonogeological history) on the permeability distribution with depth, by using regression analysis and               k               ‐means clustering. The influence of preferential sampling and hydraulic anisotropy are negligible. A scale dependency is observed based on calculated rock test volumes equaling 0.6 orders of magnitude of permeability change per order of magnitude of rock volume tested. Based on the entire data set, permeability decreases as log(               k               )~=~−1.5~×~log(               z               )~−~16.3 with permeability               k               (m               2               ) and positively increasing depth               z               (km), and depth is the main factor driving the permeability distribution. The permeability variance is about 2 orders of magnitude at all depths, presumably representing permeability variations around brittle fault zones. Permeability and specific yield/storage exhibit similar depth trends. While in the upper 200 mbgs fracture flow varies between confined and unconfined, we observe confined fracture and matrix flow below about 600 mbgs depth. The most important geological factors are current seismotectonic activity (determined by peak ground acceleration) and long‐term tectonogeological history (determined by geological province).

Such estimations must be based on all possible information available in the field; in many instances, direct transmissivity measurements from pumping tests are scarce, whereas indirect estimations based on specific capacity data are more numerous. It is, however, possible to use jointly both types of data when a geostatistical estimation technique is used. Four such methods will be compared here: (1) kriging combined with linear regression, (2) cokriging, (3) kriging with an external drift, and (4) kriging with a guess field. This comparison is made both on a set of real field data and on a theoretical case, where the “true” solution is known.},

Geographic connections between SWAT+ objects and MODFLOW grid cells are established a priori using a GIS and then read into the code to be used throughout the simulation to map hydrologic fluxes (recharge, soil water transfer, groundwater15 channel exchange, canal seepage, tile drainage outflow, groundwater-reservoir exchange, pumping for irrigation) on a daily time step. The use and general accuracy of the model is demonstrated for two study regions that are subject to irrigation management: the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado and the San Joaquin River Basin in California. An accompanying tutorial and example model data allow for easy use of the model to other study regions.

Numerous recharge structures such as percolation tanks exist but the impact of these structures on groundwater resources remains poorly understood. Although the evaporation/infiltration ratio of percolation tanks was determined in several studies in semi-arid contexts using surface water balance methods, few studies evaluated the impact on the aquifer recharge. However, knowledge on recharge dynamics over time and space is essential for (1) the quantitative evaluation of stored water volumes, (2) the identification of beneficiaries (farmers) and (3) the estimation of percolation tanks recharge zone to the extent that is required to define proper management regulations at basin scale. These three points are of prime importance in the case of semi-arid regions where a limited number of rain events determine the water stored over the entire year. Assessment of the stored groundwater is even more difficult in crystalline aquifers due to the heterogeneous structure of flow paths.},

  abstract = {Due to extensive irrigation, most crystalline aquifers of south India are overexploited. Aquifer structure consists of an upper weathered saprolite followed by a fractured zone whose fracture density decreases with depth. To achieve sustainable management, the evolution of hydrodynamic parameters (transmissivity and storage coefficient) by depth in the south Indian context should be quantified. Falling-head borehole permeameter tests, injection tests, flowmeter profiles, single-packer tests and pumping tests were carried out in the unsaturated saprolite and saturated fractured granite. Results show that the saprolite is poorly transmissive (Tfs\,=\,3\,×\,10–7 to 8.5\,×\,10–8~m2~s–1) and that the most conductive part of the aquifer corresponds to the bottom of the saprolite and the upper part of the fractured rock (T\,=\,1.0\,×\,10–3 to 7.0\,×\,10–4~m2~s–1). The transmissivity along the profile is mostly controlled by two distinct conductive zones without apparent vertical hydraulic connection. The transmissivity and storage coefficient both decrease with depth depending on the saturation of the main fracture zones, and boreholes are not exploitable after a certain depth (27.5~m on the investigated section). The numerous investigations performed allow a complete quantification with depth of the hydrodynamic parameters along the weathering profile, and a conceptual model is presented. Hydrograph observations (4~years) are shown to be relevant as a first-order characterization of the media and diffusivity evolution with depth. The evolution of these hydrodynamic parameters along the profile has a great impact on groundwater prospecting, exploitation and transport properties in such crystalline rock aquifers.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Catchment classification is an efficient method to synthesize our understanding of how climate variability and catchment characteristics interact to define hydrological response. One way to accomplish catchment classification is to empirically relate climate and catchment characteristics to hydrologic behavior and to quantify the skill of predicting hydrologic response based on the combination of climate and catchment characteristics. Here we present results using an alternative approach that uses our current level of hydrological understanding, expressed in the form of a process-based model, to interrogate how climate and catchment characteristics interact to produce observed hydrologic response. The model uses topographic, geomorphologic, soil and vegetation information at the catchment scale and conditions parameter values using readily available data on precipitation, temperature and streamflow. It is applicable to a wide range of catchments in different climate settings. We have developed a step-by-step procedure to analyze the observed hydrologic response and to assign parameter values related to specific components of the model. We applied this procedure to 12 catchments across a climate gradient east of the Rocky Mountains, USA. We show that the model is capable of reproducing the observed hydrologic behavior measured through hydrologic signatures chosen at different temporal scales. Next, we analyze the dominant time scales of catchment response and their dimensionless ratios with respect to climate and observable landscape features in an attempt to explain hydrologic partitioning. We find that only a limited number of model parameters can be related to observable landscape features. However, several climate-model time scales, and the associated dimensionless numbers, show scaling relationships with respect to the investigated hydrological signatures (runoff coefficient, baseflow index, and slope of the flow duration curve). Moreover, some dimensionless numbers vary systematically across the climate gradient, possibly as a result of systematic co-variation of climate, vegetation and soil related time scales. If such co-variation can be shown to be robust across many catchments along different climate gradients, it opens perspective for model parameterization in ungauged catchments as well as prediction of hydrologic response in a rapidly changing environment.},

  abstract = {I am deeply grateful to the members of the British National Committee for the great honour of inviting me to be your first Rankine Lecturer. The name Rankine was, of course, familiar to me in my student days. In my mind I had classified him in the same category with such eminent German engineers and teachers as Otto Mohr, Müller-Breslau, and Föppl. But until recently I had no conception of the enormous breadth and depth of Rankine's contributions in several areas of engineering as well as in pure science. And all this he accomplished in his short life span that I have exceeded already by 6 years. I could easily use the entire hour to talk about my impressions when reviewing Rankine's books and scientific papers. But may I mention just one item that concerns the conflict between theoretical science and engineering, a topic often discussed at the present time particularly in the United States where we are undergoing a period of critical review of engineering education and are groping for something new that nobody seems to be able to define clearly. As always in periods of uncertainty, there is a tendency to be over critical of past efforts; there is a danger of “throwing the baby out with the bath water”—at least that is the impression I have about certain changes which are being attempted in the teaching of civil engineering at some of our schools. Let me read two short paragraphs that bring out in essence what Rankine thought about this conflict that seems to have already existed in his days. My quotation is from his inaugural address when he accepted the professorship at the University of Glasgow, in 1856. This is what he said more than 100 years ago:             “In theoretical science, the question is—What are we to think?—and when a doubtful point arises, for the solution of which either experimental data are wanting, or mathematical methods are not sufficiently advanced, it is the duty of philosophic minds not to dispute about the probability of conflicting suppositions, but to labour for the advancement of experimental inquiry and of mathematics, and await patiently the time when these shall be adequate to solve the question.             “But in practical science the question is—What are we to do?—a question which in volves the necessity for the immediate adoption of some rule of working. In doubtful cases, we cannot allow our machines and our works of improvement to wait for the advancement of science; and if existing data are insufficient to give an exact solution of the question, that approximate solution must be acted upon which the best data attainable show to be the most most probable. A prompt and sound judgement in cases of this kind is one of the characteristics of a PRACTICAL MAN, in the right sense of that term.”             This is, indeed, the best definition of the difference between theoretical science and engineering I have been able to find. Also, it serves as an admirable introduction to the subject of my Lecture in which I will make use of theory to supplement empirical knowledge and to enhance “sound judgement”.},

This paper describes an integrated approach for investigating catchment hydrology in the development of a hydropower and a canal irrigation system based on model analyses. The investigation aims to adequately determine an optimal domestic and irrigation water resources allocation scheme based on an assessment of the reservoir water balance and capacity for hydropower. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) which characterizes basin hydrology and the water management and planning model MODSIM which provides a decision support system for water allocation optimization, were used in this study. The integrated approach was applied to Prek Te River basin in Cambodia. The water demand aspect was examined based on domestic water use, irrigation water, environmental flow, and water losses. An operational rule curve was developed for hydropower operation with respect to a power potential of 13 MW. Hydrologic modeling revealed 90 \% dependable water of about 2.7 m3/s during the dry season and 214.3 m3/s during the wet season, indicative of a wet-season dependent reservoir for storage. Results from the 26-years simulation period also showed that diversions for domestic water and irrigation water supply were 92.3 \% dependable for a 13 MW capacity hydropower development. The integrated approach was shown to be a valuable decision support tool for water resources management with the determination of an optimum policy for multi-purpose reservoir operation based on available basin water supply.},

Both the type of measurement and its characteristic scale (that is, the rock volume over which an individual permeability value is integrated) are responsible for this. Brace [1980, 1984] compiled permeabilities of sedimentary (porous) and crystalline (fractured) rocks and pointed out that both types of rock exhibit a “scale effect”: the larger the experiment's scale, or characteristic volume, the greater the permeability. One other transport parameter, dispersion length or dispersivity, which is closely related to permeability, behaves similarly. There are both data compilations for dispersivity documenting this scale effect [Beims, 1983; Gelhar et al., 1985] and theoretical studies (such as Neumann [1990]) discussing possible scaling rules. An interesting conclusion by Neumann [1990], which is in good agreement with Brace's results, is that 'porous and fractured media appear to follow the same idealized scaling rule for both flow and transport, raising a question about the validity of many distinctions commonly drawn between such media.'},

  abstract = {We study the influence of topography on groundwater fluxes and water table depths across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Groundwater tables are often conceptualized as subdued replicas of topography. While it is well known that groundwater configuration is also controlled by geology and climate, nonlinear interactions between these drivers within large real-world systems are not well understood and are difficult to characterize given sparse groundwater observations. We address this limitation using the fully integrated physical hydrology model ParFlow to directly simulate groundwater fluxes and water table depths within a complex heterogeneous domain that incorporates all three primary groundwater drivers. Analysis is based on a first of its kind, continental-scale, high-resolution (1 km), groundwater-surface water simulation spanning more than 6.3 million km2. Results show that groundwater fluxes are most strongly driven by topographic gradients (as opposed to gradients in pressure head) in humid regions with small topographic gradients or low conductivity. These regions are generally consistent with the topographically controlled groundwater regions identified in previous studies. However, we also show that areas where topographic slopes drive groundwater flux do not generally have strong correlations between water table depth and elevation. Nonlinear relationships between topography and water table depth are consistent with groundwater flow systems that are dominated by local convergence and could also be influenced by local variability in geology and climate. One of the strengths of the numerical modeling approach is its ability to evaluate continental-scale groundwater behavior at a high resolution not possible with other techniques.},

  abstract = {Surface and subsurface flows interact at different spatial and temporal scales through the development of saturated areas occurring when the aquifer reaches the surface. While this interaction exerts a strong control in the partitioning of water between base flow, seepage flow and overland flow, its quantification remains a challenge. Here, we propose a novel modeling approach based on two equivalent hillslopes to capture spatial and temporal variabilities of the main processes. We calibrate their subsurface hydraulic properties based on the temporal dynamics of stream discharge. The model is tested on two pilot catchments located in Brittany (France). For both catchments, the model is successfully calibrated on 40~years of stream discharge data. The results demonstrate that contrasted hydraulic properties are required, with: (1) a relatively low conductive hillslope (conductivities between 3x10–8m/s and 2x10–6m/s) enhancing overland flows during recharge periods while also sustaining low flows in the late recession period through slow aquifer discharge, and (2) a highly diffusive hillslope (diffusivity between 5x10–3m2/s and 3x10–1m2/s) dominantly shaping the event- to seasonal-scale streamflow recession behavior. The strong contrast of the two hillslopes reveals the fundamental role of heterogeneity in controlling groundwater storage-discharge functions, ruling out any homogeneous equivalent at the catchment scale. Low flows appear to be a non-obvious combination of the contributions of the two hillslopes, the less diffusive hillslope catching up to the more conductive one by the end of the low flow period. Catchment-scale responses integrate complex interactions between recharge, groundwater and overland flows through the volume of subsurface storage and the extent of the saturated area.},

  abstract = {Groundwater is the world's most important freshwater resource. Despite this importance, groundwater flow and interactions between groundwater and other parts of the hydrological cycle are often neglected or simplified in large-scale hydrological models. One of the challenges in simulating groundwater flow and continental to global scales is the lack of consistent globally available hydrogeological data. These input data are needed for a more realistic physical representation of the groundwater system, enabling the simulation of groundwater head dynamics and lateral flows. A realistic representation of the subsurface is especially important as large-scale hydrological models move to finer resolutions and aim to provide accurate and locally relevant hydrologic information everywhere. In this study, we aim at improving and extending on current available large-scale data sets providing information of the subsurface. We present a detailed aquifer representation for the continental United States and Canada at hyper resolution (250 × 250 m). We integrate local hydrogeological information, including observations of aquifer layer thickness, conductivity, and vertical structure, to obtain representative aquifer parameter values applicable to the continental scale. The methods used are simple and can be expanded to other parts of the world. Hydrological simulations were performed using the integrated hydrological model ParFlow and demonstrated improved model performance when using the new aquifer parameterization. Our results support that more detailed and accurate aquifer parameterization will advance our understanding of the groundwater system at larger scales.},

This paper aims to test the robustness of a first-order hydraulic conductivity map estimated from both a detailed water-table map and hydraulic-conductivity statistics on a granitic watershed in Brittany (57 km2), compare it to local estimates and assess it through various numerical models. Map values range on four orders of magnitude (10-7 to 10-4 m/s, mean: 3.9x10-6 m/s) and their comparison to local estimates from various sources (pumping tests, MRS measurements, streamflow) gives satisfactory results.},

  abstract = {Estimating the transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity field to characterize the heterogeneity of a crystalline aquifer is particularly difficult because of the wide variations of the parameters. We developed a new approach based on the analysis of a dense network of water-table data. It is based on the concept that large-scale variations in hydraulic head may give information on large-scale aquifer parameters. The method assumes that flux into the aquifer is mainly sub-horizontal and that the water table is mostly controlled by topography, rather than recharge. It is based on an empirical statistical relationship between field data on transmissivity and the inverse slope values of a topography-reduced water-table map. This relationship is used to compute a transmissivity map that must be validated with field measurements. The proposed approach can provide a general pattern of transmissivity, or hydraulic conductivity, but cannot correctly reproduce strong variations at very local scale (less than10m), and will face of some uncertainties where vertical flows cannot be neglected. The method was tested on a peridotite (ultramafic rock) aquifer of 3.5~km2 in area located in New Caledonia. The resulting map shows transmissivity variations over about 5 orders of magnitude (average LogT: −5.2±0.7). Comparison with a map based on measured water-level data (n=475) shows that the comparison between LogT-computed values and LogT data deduced from 28 hydraulic tests is estimated with an error less than 20\% in 71\% of cases (LogT±0.4), and with an error less than 10\% (LogT±0.2 on average) in 39\% of cases. From this map a hydraulic-conductivity map has been computed showing values ranging over 8 orders of magnitude. The repeatability of the approach was tested on a second data set of hydraulic-head measurements (n=543); the mean deviation between both LogT maps is about 11\%. These encouraging results show that the method can give valuable parameter estimates, and can characterize aquifer heterogeneity. The computed LogT and LogK maps highlight the spatial distribution of parameters that show a pattern clearly controlled by the fault network of this ultramafic massif. However, the faults are mainly characterized by low-permeability zones; this differs from results on other crystalline aquifers and may be due to the fact that weathering products of peridotite are clay-like materials. The resulting transmissivity map can be used as a starting point for modelling or to direct additional fieldwork.},

  abstract = {An innovative approach for regionalizing the 3-D effective porosity field is presented and applied to two large, overexploited, and deeply weathered crystalline aquifers located in southern India. The method derives from earlier work on regionalizing a 2-D effective porosity field in that part of an aquifer where the water table fluctuates, which is now extended over the entire aquifer using a 3-D approach. A method based on geological and geophysical surveys has also been developed for mapping the weathering profile layers (saprolite and fractured layers). The method for regionalizing 3-D effective porosity combines water table fluctuation and groundwater budget techniques at various cell sizes with the use of satellite-based data (for groundwater abstraction), the structure of the weathering profile, and geostatistical techniques. The approach is presented in detail for the Kudaliar watershed (983 km2) and tested on the 730 km2 Anantapur watershed. At watershed scale, the effective porosity of the aquifer ranges from 0.5\% to 2\% in Kudaliar and between 0.3\% and 1\% in Anantapur, which agrees with earlier works. Results show that (a) depending on the geology and on the structure of the weathering profile, the vertical distribution of effective porosity can be very different and that the fractured layers in crystalline aquifers are not necessarily characterized by a rapid decrease in effective porosity and (b) that the lateral variations in effective porosity can be larger than the vertical ones. These variations suggest that within a same weathering profile, the density of open fractures and/or degree of weathering in the fractured zone may significantly vary from a place to another. The proposed method provides information on the spatial distribution of effective porosity that is of prime interest in terms of flux and contaminant transport in crystalline aquifers. Implications for mapping groundwater storage and scarcity are also discussed, which should help in improving groundwater resource management strategies.},

  abstract = {Le projet MORPHEUS, MéthOdologie de Régionalisation des Propriétés HydrogEologiques des aqUifères de Socle, s’inscrit dans la poursuite des travaux initiés au BRGM sur les aquifères de socle. Ce programme R\&D a permis de tester des méthodes de spatialisation des propriétés hydrodynamiques à une échelle beaucoup plus fine, interne aux aquifères, que celles proposées dans les précédents travaux. Les méthodes et approches préalablement développées (en Inde, Nouvelle Calédonie) ont été testées et adaptées, dans la mesure des données disponibles, sur des aquifères de socle Breton : le bassin du Nançon (57 km2, granites ; département d’Ille-et-Vilaine) et dans une moindre mesure sur le bassin de la Maudouve-Noë Sèche (40 km2, granites et migmatites ; département des Côtes d’Armor). Sur ce territoire, des bases de données librement accessibles (comme la Banque de données du Sous-Sol [BSS]) et des mesures de terrain d’acquisition facile (piézométrie, débit de cours d’eau) ont été mobilisées pour voir s’il était possible d’obtenir des champs de perméabilité et de porosité satisfaisants sur les bassins versants proposés. Les méthodes mises en œuvre ont permis de proposer des cartes de paramètres hydrogéologiques, comme la porosité (bassin du Nançon seul) et la perméabilité (Nançon et Maudouve-Noë Sèche). Pour la porosité (Nançon seulement), la comparaison des données en fonction de la position au sein du profil d’altération montre des résultats très satisfaisants vis-à-vis de la distribution de la porosité au sein du profil, mais aussi vis-à-vis des mesures de teneur en eau obtenues par RMP. Les données sont aussi concordantes avec les estimations faites sur des bassins versants en Inde dans des granites. Une spatialisation en 3D du champ de porosité a aussi été conduite en procédant à une cartographie du champ de porosité des différents niveaux du profil d’altération. En moyenne et à l’échelle du bassin versant, les altérites ont une porosité de 2\% environ, les 5 premiers mètres de zone fracturée de 1,4\%, et la zone fracturée sous-jacente (épaisseur moyenne de 32 m) de 0,3\%. Ce champ 3D a permis de faire une estimation du stock d’eau présent dans l’aquifère. Il correspond à une lame d’eau d’environ 400 mm, dont 240 mm au sein de la zone fracturée. Pour la recharge (Nançon seulement), plusieurs méthodes ont été mises en œuvre afin de l’évaluer : l’outil ESPERE (©brgm), la modélisation Gardénia (©brgm) et une méthode de fluctuation de nappe. L’estimation de la recharge avec l’outil ESPERE est cohérente de l’infiltration totale déduite de la modélisation Gardénia (env. 260 mm/an). Par contre, la modélisation Gardénia a permis de préciser que le flux de recharge vers l’aquifère profond (zone fracturée) est de l’ordre de 100 mm/an en moyenne, une valeur cohérente avec celle obtenue par méthode de fluctuation de nappe (120 mm/an). La carte de recharge obtenue par méthode de fluctuation de nappe est une carte approximative permettant de visualiser les secteurs plus propices à la recharge. Elle a permis de mettre en évidence, qu’en moyenne, les secteurs où l’épaisseur d’altérites est importante favorisent la recharge ; un résultat vraisemblablement réaliste. Pour la perméabilité, dans un premier temps une approche théorique de modélisation a été menée à partir de divers champs de perméabilité théorique. Pour se faire, la géométrie du bassin du Nançon a été utilisée. Les champs de perméabilité déduits de l’analyse des cartes piézométriques générées par le modèle ont montré des résultats satisfaisants. Cependant, même si la technique ne permet pas de retrouver de manière exacte le champ de perméabilité initial, elle permet d’évaluer la structure du champ de perméabilités, de fournir une répartition spatiale de celui-ci et de donner les ordres de grandeur des perméabilités rencontrées. Dans un second temps, l’application de la méthode de régionalisation de la perméabilité à partir de cartes piézométriques détaillées a été réalisée sur les bassins versants du Nançon et de la Maudouve- Noë Sèche. Elle montre des résultats cohérents vis-à-vis des autres sources d’informations disponibles : essais par pompage, estimations par méthode RMP et à partir du débit des cours d’eau. Les cartes de perméabilité produites montrent une variation de la perméabilité des aquifères sur 4 ordres de grandeur (10-7 à 10-4 m/s) pour une valeur moyenne d’environ 3x10-6 m/s pour les deux bassins versants. Enfin, les cartes de perméabilité ont été testées par modélisation hydrodynamique maillée en régime permanent (modèle MARTHE ©brgm), ce qui a permis de rendre compte de leur pertinence et de tester la sensibilité de l’approche menée. Les modélisations ont été plus poussées sur le bassin du Nançon afin de rendre compte de plusieurs méthodes d’exploitation de la carte de régionalisation de la perméabilité produite. Sur le bassin de la Maudouve-Noë Sèche la modélisation a eu pour unique objectif de tester la sensibilité de la carte produite. Les modélisations montrent que le champ de perméabilité brut permet de reproduire les directions d’écoulement mais a tendance à surestimer la perméabilité, en particulier sur les secteurs où il n’y a pas de mesure piézométrique. Sur les secteurs où l’on dispose de suffisamment d’information sur la piézométrie, et donc là où le champ a pu être le mieux estimé, l’erreur quadratique moyenne (Root Mean Square Error, RMSE) est de 3,7 m, ce qui est un bon résultat (cas du Nançon). Pour la Maudouve-Noë Sèche la RMSE est de 6,5 m, ce qui est compte tenu de la densité des observations un bon résultat. Par ailleurs, pour les deux bassins versants, les débits de débordement de la nappe sont comparables aux jaugeages effectués dans de nombreux sous-bassins, montrant ainsi la robustesse des champs de perméabilité. Enfin, le champ brut a servi à contraindre l’établissement d’un champ de perméabilité généré automatiquement par méthode d’inversion pour le bassin du Nançon. Dans ce cas, les valeurs du champ de perméabilité régionalisé servent à contraindre à l’inversion en fixant des gammes de variations possible de la perméabilité (valeurs moyenne, minimale, moyenne) et à la définition de zones de perméabilité homogène (deux dans le cas présent). L’utilisation de ce champ à deux zones, dont les valeurs sont obtenues par méthode d’inversion automatique, a permis d’aboutir à des résultats très satisfaisants en terme de restitution de la piézométrie observée (RMSE : 1,8m). La méthode de régionalisation permet de produire un champ de perméabilité (brut) qui, même si on peut douter de la réalité de la valeur estimée de la perméabilité en un point donné, montre une bonne cohérence des zones à fortes et faibles perméabilités. Ce qui est pris, ici, comme un sérieux avantage pour réaliser la modélisation numérique de la surface piézométrique où la création de zones à perméabilités différentes permet une modélisation relativement robuste. L’autre avantage de la méthode de régionalisation de la perméabilité est que, contrairement à l’inversion du champ de perméabilité par modèle mathématique, il n’est pas nécessaire d’imposer de flux de recharge ou d’autres conditions aux limites, ni même de géométrie, autant de conditions difficiles à estimer qui peuvent influencer le champ de perméabilité déduit d’une inversion numérique automatique. L’utilisation conjointe de la méthode de régionalisation et de l’inversion numérique permet donc de réduire les incertitudes.},

  abstract = {Two innovative approaches for upscaling and regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity at watershed scale are proposed. They are based on the concept that large-scale variations in hydraulic head may characterize large-scale properties and were tested on an unconfined granitic aquifer exposed to deep weathering, located in South India (Maheshwaram watershed, 53km2). Both methods are based on field data such as water levels, discharge rates of irrigation wells, geological observations and the results of small-scale hydraulic tests. The resulting hydraulic-conductivity map uses the statistical empirical relationship between log-normal distributions of hydraulic conductivity from small-scale tests and linear discharge rates from exploited wells, i.e. the ratio between discharge rate and the saturated aquifer thickness. The empirical relationship agrees with Thiem–Dupuit’s assumption for unconfined aquifers. The performance of the method was compared to the values of local hydraulic-conductivity estimates deduced from small-scale tests (not used for drawing the map). About 90\% of simulated values varies less than 20\% from local measurements (LogK±0.4 on average), which is reasonable considering the complexity of the studied fractured aquifer. The regionalization of the effective porosity was based on a method that combines both water-table fluctuation and groundwater-budget techniques in the absence of recharge from rainfall. However, the use of these techniques at cell scale requires a good knowledge of groundwater flux to and from the cells, which here is unknown. To avoid this difficulty a coarse-graining method was used, assuming that increasing the cell size for such computations leads to a negligible contribution of these flux compared to net groundwater abstraction from the cell. Our results show that cell sizes over 520×520m achieve a negligible balance. In addition, porosity maps provide average values of around 1.5\% that are almost identical to the ones previously found at watershed scale. The proposed methods for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields provide access not only to the average large-scale values, but also to their spatial distribution, which is of prime interest in terms of flux and contaminant transport in a hard-rock environment. The uncertainty introduced by field data, the choice of the computation scale as the impact of cell size on the calculated effective porosity value and the possible meaning of their spatial variations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Water tables at regional to continental scales can be classified into two distinct types: recharge-controlled water tables that are largely disconnected from topography and topography-controlled water tables that are closely tied to topography. We use geomatic synthesis of hydrologic, geologic and topographic data sets to quantify and map water-table type over the contiguous United States using a dimensionless criterion introduced by Haitjema and Mitchell-Bruker (2005), called the water-table ratio, which differentiates water-table type. Our analysis indicates that specific regions of the United States have broadly contiguous and characteristic water-table types. Water-table ratio relates to water-table depth and the potential for regional groundwater flow. In regions with recharge-controlled water tables, for example the Southwest or Rocky Mountains, USA, water-tables depths are generally greater and more variable and regional groundwater flow is generally more important as a percentage of the watershed budget. Water-table depths are generally shallow and less variable, and regional groundwater flow is limited in areas with topography-controlled water tables such as the Northeast USA. The water-table ratio is a simple but powerful criterion for evaluating regional groundwater systems over broad areas.},

  abstract = {Permeability, the ease of fluid flow through porous rocks and soils, is a fundamental but often poorly quantified component in the analysis of regional-scale water fluxes. Permeability is difficult to quantify because it varies over more than 13 orders of magnitude and is heterogeneous and dependent on flow direction. Indeed, at the regional scale, maps of permeability only exist for soil to depths of 1–2 m. Here we use an extensive compilation of results from hydrogeologic models to show that regional-scale ({$>$}5 km) permeability of consolidated and unconsolidated geologic units below soil horizons (hydrolithologies) can be characterized in a statistically meaningful way. The representative permeabilities of these hydrolithologies are used to map the distribution of near-surface (on the order of 100 m depth) permeability globally and over North America. The distribution of each hydrolithology is generally scale independent. The near-surface mean permeability is of the order of ∼5 × 10−14 m2. The results provide the first global picture of near-surface permeability and will be of particular value for evaluating global water resources and modeling the influence of climate-surface-subsurface interactions on global climate change.},

  abstract = {The hydrometeorological model SIM consists of a meteorological analysis system (SAFRAN), a land surface model (ISBA), and a hydrogeological model (MODCOU). It generates atmospheric forcing at an hourly time step, and it computes water and surface energy budgets, the river flow at more than 900 river-gauging stations, and the level of several aquifers. SIM was extended over all of France in order to have a homogeneous nationwide monitoring of the water resources: it can therefore be used to forecast flood risk and to monitor drought risk over the entire nation. The hydrometeorological model was applied over a 10-year period from 1995 to 2005. In this paper the databases used by the SIM model are presented; then the 10-year simulation is assessed by using the observations of daily streamflow, piezometric head, and snow depth. This assessment shows that SIM is able to reproduce the spatial and temporal variabilities of the water fluxes. The efficiency is above 0.55 (reasonable results) for 66\% of the simulated river gauges, and above 0.65 (rather good results) for 36\% of them. However, the SIM system produces worse results during the driest years, which is more likely due to the fact that only few aquifers are simulated explicitly. The annual evolution of the snow depth is well reproduced, with a square correlation coefficient around 0.9 over the large altitude range in the domain. The streamflow observations were used to estimate the overall error of the simulated latent heat flux, which was estimated to be less than 4\%.},

  abstract = {a géologie du département de l’Orne a pour particularité d’être située à cheval entre le Massif Armoricain à l’ouest, avec ses formations géologiques dites de socle (roches cristallines à cristallophylliennes ou métamorphiques ainsi que les formations sédimentaires plissées du Paléozoïque), et le Bassin Parisien à l’est, avec ses formations sédimentaires plus récentes (Mésozoïque et Cénozoïque). Du fait de cette géologie contrastée, deux grands types d’aquifères sont présents :  Les aquifères compartimentés, discontinus et fissurés, dits « de socle »,  Les aquifères sédimentaires, stratifiés et plus ou moins continus. Ces réservoirs ont un comportement hydraulique spécifique lié à l’histoire géologique des roches qui les constituent, où les lithologies affectées par des éléments structuraux (failles, plis, ...) contribuent au fonctionnement hydraulique des nappes d’eau souterraine. La connaissance du fonctionnement des ressources en eau souterraine est aujourd’hui un enjeu majeur pour développer les stratégies nécessaires à leur gestion durable et à celle des milieux aquatiques associés. Malheureusement, les informations permettant la compréhension de leur fonctionnement sont souvent incomplètes, en partie notamment à cause d’une dispersion des données, à une répartition inégale de l’information sur le territoire, à un manque de valorisation de l’information et à un accès aux ressources documentaires de ce fait, rendu difficile. Pour répondre à ces enjeux, le Syndicat Départemental de l’Eau de l’Orne (SDE61) et le BRGM Normandie ont donc travaillé, avec leurs partenaires, à la mise en œuvre d’un programme en 2 phases d’Amélioration des connaissances Géologiques et Hydrogéologiques pour l’ensemble du département de l’Orne, qui vise à créer un outil intégré d’aide à la gestion patrimoniale des ressources en eau souterraine du département (programme OAGPRO61 bis). L’étude, objet du présent rapport, représente la première phase du Programme OAGPRO61 Bis. Elle a permis de recueillir et de valoriser les informations facilement disponibles au Syndicat Départemental des Eaux de l’Orne et au BRGM, afin de proposer une synthèse bibliographique des connaissances hydrogéologiques sur le fonctionnement des grands aquifères du domaine sédimentaire et de socle. Les entités concernées étaient les suivantes :  Les aquifères du Briovérien, des granitoïdes et de leur auréole de métamorphisme, les formations paléozoïques pour le domaine de socle,  La craie céno-turonienne, les sables du Perche, les formations oxfordiennes et enfin les calcaires du Bajocien-Bathonien pour les formations du domaine sédimentaire. Ce travail s’est donc appuyé sur ce socle de connaissances afin de préciser de manière générale et pour chacun des grands aquifères :  Leur fonctionnement général (aquifère à nappe libre ou captive, rôle de la fracturation ou du karst et les conditions d’alimentation et de recharge), Synthèse des connaissances géologiques et hydrogéologiques du département de l’Orne Volet Hydrogéologique (Programme OAGPRO61 bis) 6 BRGM/RP-69331-FR – Rapport final  Les directions des principaux écoulements, lorsqu’une piézométrie était disponible,  Les fluctuations des niveaux, dont l’analyse des chroniques des ouvrages de suivi piézométrique (SDE61 et BRGM),  Les paramètres hydrodynamiques et autres indicateurs de productivité. Ce travail a également permis de réaliser une synthèse générale des connaissances sur le fonctionnement des aquifères du socle armoricain et de proposer une méthodologie de caractérisation de ces derniers, transposable au domaine Nord-Armoricain et plus particulièrement au contexte du département de l’Orne. Ce travail de synthèse préliminaire a également permis de mettre en évidence un certain nombre de lacunes, notamment : l’absence d’informations précises sur les sens et directions d’écoulement, de la position des eaux souterraines par rapport aux eaux superficielles (niveau perchés, à l’équilibre, drainant), de l’absence d’évaluation des épaisseurs d’altérites et d’horizon fissuré, du rôle de drain ou non des principales fractures « tectoniques », etc... Ces éléments sont pourtant essentiels pour avoir une vision plus précise du fonctionnement des aquifères sédimentaires et de socle permettant de fournir des indicateurs opérationnels de gestion ou de protection efficace de ces ressources (comme par exemple : zone d’alimentation/protection, vulnérabilité, risque inondation et sécheresse, secteurs productifs, suivi des eaux souterraine, etc...). Pour répondre à ces enjeux, la suite du programme OAGPRO61 bis (phase 2 à venir) s’attachera donc en conséquence à fournir les informations utiles à une meilleure gouvernance :  L’élaboration de cartes piézométriques à l’échelle départementale pour chaque grand ensemble aquifère (piézométrie reconstituée à partir des données existantes et d’hypothèses de travail qui seront formulées).  La caractérisation des propriétés et du fonctionnement des systèmes aquifères sédimentaires et de socle, au regard notamment : o Des secteurs où existe un manteau d’altération et/ou un horizon fissuré susceptible d’indiquer la présence d’un aquifère à perméabilité significative. o Des secteurs où prédomine un réseau de fractures et failles d’origine tectonique pouvant favoriser la circulation et l’altération de la roche. o D’un bilan du fonctionnement des aquifères par ensemble litho-structural, mise en évidence d’éventuelles interactions. o De la réalisation de bilans quantitatifs, en s’appuyant sur une dizaine de modèles globaux à l’échelle des grands bassins versants. o D’un bilan général de la qualité des eaux des principaux aquifères.  L’établissement d’indicateurs de gestion des ressources, de l’ordre de grandeur du potentiel des ressources en eau en termes de volumes théoriques disponibles et de cartes thématiques utiles mettant en évidence les propriétés des aquifères, leurs secteurs vulnérables ou sensibles sur le plan « qualité des eaux », les secteurs présentant un potentiel de développement, notamment. Enfin, un volet de valorisation et de diffusion des résultats permettra de communiquer, à un large public, les résultats de l’ensemble du programme.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a DEM assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30m cell−1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

Despite its widespread use, essentially no theoretical results have been proved explicitly for the Nelder–Mead algorithm. This paper presents convergence properties of the Nelder–Mead algorithm applied to strictly convex functions in dimensions 1 and 2. We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder–Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer. It is not yet known whether the Nelder–Mead method can be proved to converge to a minimizer for a more specialized class of convex functions in two dimensions.},

And you want the skills required to distill a messy pile of data into actionable insights. We call this the data science lifecycle: the process of collecting, wrangling, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Learning Data Science is the first book to cover foundational skills in both programming and statistics that encompass this entire lifecycle. It's aimed at those who wish to become data scientists or who already work with data scientists, and at data analysts who wish to cross the "technical/nontechnical" divide. If you have a basic knowledge of Python programming, you'll learn how to work with data using industry-standard tools like pandas.--},

  abstract = {Abstract                            There are millions of river barriers worldwide, ranging from wooden locks to concrete dams, many of which form associated impoundments to store water in small ponds or large reservoirs. Besides their benefits, there is growing recognition of important environmental and social trade-offs related to these artificial structures. However, global datasets describing their characteristics and geographical distribution are often biased towards particular regions or specific applications, such as hydropower dams affecting fish migration, and are thus not globally consistent. Here, we present a new river barrier and reservoir database developed by the Global Dam Watch (GDW) consortium that integrates, harmonizes, and augments existing global datasets to support large-scale analyses. Data curation involved extensive quality control processes to create a single, globally consistent data repository of instream barriers and reservoirs that are co-registered to a digital river network. Version 1.0 of the GDW database contains 41,145 barrier locations and 35,295 associated reservoir polygons representing a cumulative storage capacity of 7,420 km               3               and an artificial terrestrial surface water area of 304,600\,km               2               .},

This paper describes the impact of the various changes made to the Safran–Isba–Modcou (SIM) hydrometeorological system and demonstrates that the new version of the model performs better than the previous one by making comparisons with observations of daily river flows and snow depths. SIM was developed and put into operational service at Météo-France in the early 2000s. The SIM application is dedicated to the monitoring of water resources and can therefore help in drought monitoring or flood risk forecasting on French territory. This complex system combines three models: SAFRAN, which analyses meteorological variables close to the surface, the ISBA land surface model, which aims to calculate surface fluxes at the interface with the atmosphere and ground variables, and finally MODCOU, a hydrogeological model which calculates river flows and changes in groundwater levels. The SIM model has been improved first by reducing the infrared radiation bias of SAFRAN and then by using the more advanced ISBA multi-layer surface diffusion scheme to have a more physical representation of surface and ground processes. In addition, more accurate and recent databases of vegetation, soil texture, and orography were used. Finally, in mountainous areas, a sub-grid orography representation using elevation bands was adopted, as was the possibility of adding a reservoir to represent the effect of aquifers in mountainous areas. The numerical simulations carried out with the SIM model covered the period from 1958 to 2018, thereby providing an extensive historical analysis of the water resources over France.},

The method developed here consists of two steps. First, hard data (hydraulic head) and soft data (dry wells) are used as conditioning points for the estimation of the SW-GW connection status. A disconnection criteria of 0.75\&thinsp;m is adjusted on observed unsaturated zone depth (UZD). It is a default value in areas where such data are missing. The second step consists of the final mapping of the water table. Given the knowledge of the disconnection criteria, the final map is achieved with an ordinary kriging of the UZD that integrates the surface water elevation without unsaturated zone where it is relevant. The methodology is demonstrated on two datasets of UZD observations that were collected under low- and high-flow conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Geostatistical estimation (kriging) and geostatistical simulation are routinely used in ground water hydrology for optimal spatial interpolation and Monte Carlo risk assessment, respectively. Both techniques are based on a model of spatial variability (semivariogram or covariance) that generally is not known but must be inferred from the experimental data. Where the number of experimental data is small (say, several tens), as is not unusual in ground water hydrology, the model fitted to the empirical semivariogram entails considerable uncertainty. If all the practical results are based on this unique fitted model, the final results will be biased. We propose that, instead of using a unique semivariogram model, the full range of models that are inside a given confidence region should be used, and the weight that each semivariogram model has on the final result should depend on its plausibility. The first task, then, is to evaluate the uncertainty of the model, which can be efficiently done by using maximum likelihood inference. The second task is to use the range of plausible models in applications and to show the effect observed on the final results. This procedure is put forth here with kriging and simulation applications, where the uncertainty in semivariogram parameters is propagated into the final results (e.g., the prediction of ground water head). A case study using log‐transmissivity data from the Vega de Granada aquifer, in southern Spain, is given to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {Geostatistical estimations of the hydraulic conductivity field (K) in the Carrizo aquifer, Texas, are performed over three regional domains of increasing extent: 1) the domain corresponding to a three-dimensional groundwater flow model previously built (model domain); 2) the area corresponding to the 10 counties encompassing the model domain (County domain), and; 3) the full extension of the Carrizo aquifer within Texas (Texas domain). Two different approaches are used: 1) an indirect approach where transmissivity (T) is estimated first and K is retrieved through division of the T estimate by the screen length of the wells, and; 2) a direct approach where K data are kriged directly. Due to preferential well screen emplacement, and scarcity of sampling in the deeper portions of the formation ({$>$} 1 km), the available data set is biased toward high values of hydraulic conductivities. Kriging combined with linear regression, simple kriging with varying local means, kriging with an external drift, and cokriging allow the incorporation of specific capacity as secondary information. Prediction performances (assessed through cross-validation) differ according to the chosen approach, the considered variable (log-transformed or back-transformed), and the scale of interest. For the indirect approach, kriging of log T with varying local means yields the best estimates for both log-transformed and back-transformed variables in the model domain. For larger regional scales (County and Texas domains), cokriging performs generally better than other kriging procedures when estimating both (log T)∗ and T∗. Among procedures using the direct approach, the best prediction performances are obtained using kriging of log K with an external drift. Overall, geostatistical estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field at regional scales is rendered difficult by both preferential well location and preferential emplacement of well screens in the most productive portions of the aquifer. Such bias creates unrealistic hydraulic conductivity values, in particular, in sparsely sampled areas.},

  abstract = {Python 3 is more versatile and easier to use than ever. It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax. Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software. You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program. You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy. This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published},

  abstract = {The years 2018 to 2023 were characterised by extreme hydrometeorological conditions, with record-high average annual air temperatures and record-low annual precipitation across large regions of Europe. Berlin, the capital of Germany, is potentially vulnerable to drought conditions due to its location in a relatively dry region with relatively high water demand and complex water resources management in the Spree and Obere Havel catchments. To address the impacts of the 2018–2023 drought, various water resources management measures were implemented in Berlin and in the Spree and Obere Havel catchments.  As a case study of how droughts impact large cities, we analysed observed and modelled time series of hydrometeorological, hydrogeological, and hydrological variables in Berlin and the Spree and Obere Havel catchments to characterise the years 2018–2023 in comparison with long-term averages.  We found that the meteorological drought propagated into soil moisture drought and hydrological drought, e.g. in terms of record-low groundwater and surface water levels and streamflow, with smaller rivers drying up. Due to the intensity and duration of the drought, water resources management was only able to partially counteract the drought situation, so water use was partially limited, e.g. in terms of shipping. Enhanced proportions of sewage water and reverse flow were associated with detectable concentrations of trace substances. However, Berlin's water supply was always guaranteed and represents a stable system.  Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent meteorological droughts, which will have more severe hydrological impacts in the future due to socioeconomic changes in Berlin (increasing population) and the catchments (termination of mining discharges). Therefore, water resources management in Berlin and in the Spree and Obere Havel catchments needs to be adapted to combat such situations, taking into account the lessons learned from the 2018–2023 drought and possible future developments.  This integrative and multidisciplinary study can help better assess drought impacts in the Berlin–Brandenburg region and guide water management planning under potentially drier conditions. We suggest that the integrative approach presented here can be transferred and adapted to study drought impacts on other large cities.},

  abstract = {This work is aimed at estimating the transmissivity of highly fractured hard rock aquifers using a geostatistical approach. The studied aquifer is formed by the crystalline and metamorphic rocks of the Western Ivory Coast (West Africa), in the Man Danané area. The study area covers 7290km2 (90km×81km). The fracturing network is dense and well connected, without a marked fracture direction. A data base comprising 118 transmissivity (T) values and 154 specific capacity (Q/s) values was compiled. A significant empirical relationship between T and Q/s was found, which enabled the transmissivity data to be supplemented. The variographic analysis of the two variables showed that the variograms of T and Q/s (which are lognormal variables) are much more structured than those of logT and logQ/s (which are normal variables). This result is contrary to what was previously published and raises the question whether normality is necessary in geostatistical analysis. Several input and geostatistical estimations of the transmissivity were tested using the cross validation procedure: measured transmissivity data; supplemented transmissivity data; kriging; cokriging. The cross validation results showed that the best estimation is provided using the kriging procedure, the transmissivity field represented by the whole data sample (measured+estimated using specific capacity) and the structural model evaluated solely on the measured transmissivity. The geostatistical approach provided in fine a reliable estimation of the transmissivity of the Man Danané aquifer, which will be used as an input in forthcoming modelling.},

  abstract = {The groundwater reservoir and its interaction with surface water facilitate lateral transport of continental water and energy. Current climate models do not account for long‐distance groundwater flow between model cells but route the atmospheric surplus (precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET)) directly to stream discharge within a model grid cell. We ask how much water exits a river basin without ever passing through its surface outlet? What are the climatologic and geologic factors influencing this flux? To answer these questions, a separation of groundwater flow from river flow is necessary. We use the ratio of stream discharge (Qr) to basin recharge (R = P − ET) for this purpose; where Qr:R {$<$} 1, a basin is considered a groundwater exporter; and where Qr:R {$>$} 1, a basin is considered a groundwater importer. Here Qr is obtained from 39 years of U.S. Geological Survey Hydro‐Climatic Data Network observed stream discharge from 1555 basins across the continental United States, and R (P − ET) is derived from 50 years of hydrologic simulation by the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. It was found that the Qr:R ratio deviates significantly from 1 across the continent. Detailed investigations of individual basins suggest that the deviations are primarily a function of geology, while climate and basin scale influence the magnitude of these deviations. Further, a marked incongruity between the surface and groundwater flow directions is apparent, suggesting that surface drainage is only partially indicative of subsurface flow regimes. The apparent significance of this long‐distance groundwater flow component reinforces the need for inclusion of the groundwater reservoir in current water cycle and climate modeling efforts.},

  abstract = {In land surface models (LSMs), the hydraulic properties of the subsurface are commonly estimated according to the texture of soils at the Earth's surface. This approach ignores macropores, fracture flow, heterogeneity, and the effects of variable distribution of water in the subsurface on effective watershed-scale hydraulic variables. Using hydrograph recession analysis, we empirically constrain estimates of watershed-scale effective hydraulic conductivities (K) and effective drainable aquifer storages (S) of all reference watersheds in the conterminous United States for which sufficient streamflow data are available (n = 1,561). Then, we use machine learning methods to model these properties across the entire conterminous United States. Model validation results in high confidence for estimates of log(K) (r2 {$>$} 0.89; 1\% {$<$} bias {$<$} 9\%) and reasonable confidence for S (r2 {$>$} 0.83; −70\% {$<$} bias {$<$} −18\%). Our estimates of effective K are, on average, two orders of magnitude higher than comparable soil-texture-based estimates of average K, confirming the importance of soil structure and preferential flow pathways at the watershed scale. Our estimates of effective S compare favorably with recent global estimates of mobile groundwater and are spatially heterogeneous (5–3,355 mm). Because estimates of S are much lower than the global maximums generally used in LSMs (e.g., 5,000 mm in Noah-MP), they may serve both to limit model spin-up time and to constrain model parameters to more realistic values. These results represent the first attempt to constrain estimates of watershed-scale effective hydraulic variables that are necessary for the implementation of LSMs for the entire conterminous United States.},

  abstract = {Highly simplified approaches continue to underpin hydrological climate change impact assessments across the Earth's mountainous regions. Fully-integrated surface-subsurface models may hold far greater potential to represent the distinctive regimes of steep, geologically-complex headwater catchments. However, their utility has not yet been tested across a wide range of mountainous settings. Here, an integrated model of two adjacent calcareous Alpine headwaters that accounts for two-dimensional surface flow, three-dimensional (3D) variably-saturated groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration is presented. An energy balance-based representation of snow dynamics contributed to the model's high-resolution forcing data, and a sophisticated 3D geological model helped to define and parameterize its subsurface structure. In the first known attempt to calibrate a catchment-scale integrated model of a mountainous region automatically, numerous uncertain model parameters were estimated. The salient features of the hydrological regime could ultimately be satisfactorily reproduced – over an 11-month evaluation period, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of simulated streamflow at the main gauging station was 0.76. Spatio-temporal visualization of the forcing data and simulated responses further confirmed the model's broad coherence. Presumably due to unresolved local subsurface heterogeneity, closely replicating the somewhat contrasting groundwater level signals observed near to one another proved more elusive. Finally, we assessed the impacts of various simplifications and assumptions that are commonly employed in physically-based modeling – including the use of spatially uniform forcings, a vertically limited model domain, and global geological data products – on key simulated outputs, finding strongly affected model performance in many cases. Although certain outstanding challenges must be overcome if the uptake of integrated models in mountain regions around the world is to increase, our work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of their application in such complex systems.},

  abstract = {Theoretically, three types of flow systems may occur in a small basin: local, intermediate, and regional. The local systems are separated by subvertical boundaries, and the systems of different order are separated by subhorizontal boundaries. The higher the topographic relief, the greater is the importance of the local systems. The flow lines of large unconfined flow systems do not cross major topographic features. Stagnant bodies of groundwater occur at points where flow systems meet or branch. Recharge and discharge areas alternate; thus only part of the basin will contribute to the baseflow of its main stream. Motion of groundwater is sluggish or nil under extended flat areas, with little chance of the water being freshened. Water level fluctuations decrease with depth, and only a small percentage of the total volume of the groundwater in the basin participates in the hydrologic cycle.},

  abstract = {A stochastic continuum model of a fractured medium conditioned on a specific set of field data is developed. Both the more conductive fractures and the less permeable matrix are generated within the framework of a single‐continuum stochastic model based on nonparametric indicator geostatistics. In the stochastic model the fracture zones are distinguished from the matrix by imposing a long‐range correlation structure for a small fraction (the highest approximately 11\%) of the hydraulic conductivity in the preferred planes of fracture zones. Results of flow arid transport simulation in three dimensions (3D) are used to illustrate the large spatial variability of point measurements, but for spatially integrated quantities the variability is reduced and results become less sensitive to correlation structure. Therefore it is suggested that spatially integrated quantities may be a more appropriate choice for predicting flow and transport in a strongly heterogeneous medium in that they are more commensurate with the level of our ignorance of the site. The issue of spatial variability giving rise to uncertainty in the site characterization of a heterogeneous medium and the prediction of transport results is also addressed. Simulations are carried out for 3D transport from point tracer sources at hundreds of locations in the medium. The breakthrough curve from each point source release is characterized by two parameters: the mean transport velocity and the dispersion coefficient. The results are presented as a statistical distribution of the transport parameters, thus quantifying the uncertainty in predicting flow and transport based on a limited amount of site characterization data.},

  abstract = {Effects of lake evaporation (EW) on basin evapotranspiration (ETB) and lake water storage change (LWSC) at lake-basin scale have never been reported for most basins on the inner Tibetan Plateau (IB). In this study, EW of 118 large lakes in 95 closed lake-basins were estimated, and its effects on ETB and LWSC over 2001–2018 were examined using a derivative-guided framework from the aspects of EW amount, rate, trend slope and inter-annual variability. We found that EW amount has a high effect (17\%) on regional ETB amount compared to the average lake area ratio (α) (∼5\%), and the effect has increased significantly (2\%/10 a). The spatial pattern of the effect is mainly controlled by α, and the increasing trend of α (0.6\%/10 a) also dominated the increasing trend in regional ETB rate (0.30 mm/a) though with large spatial heterogeneity. Variance in α and EW rate have a minor effect (∼3\%) on ETB variance, especially for the basins with lower α. The combination of quasi lake inflow (RL, 41\%) and lake surface precipitation (PW, 16\%) offset the depletion of EW (−43\%), resulting in the surplus of regional lake water (LWSC {$>$} 0). The increase in EW mount, which is mainly from lake area expansion (90\%), caused a decreasing trend in LWSC (i.e., slower growth rate) with a contribution of −59\%. This suggests a negative feedback between lake area expansion and EW amount in the IB, and the feedback may continue with the predicted area increases.},

Results show that the penetration depths of local flow systems present a good relation with capture zone size (Cl) and topography rise (Hl) of local flow systems, but poor and opposite relation with the two topographic indices of the surface water watershed. The stagnant zones are formed due to the movement of stagnation points, whose velocity magnitude is almost zero. The area and depth of stagnant zones below the mountains have a good or no relation with the mountain size, depending on the hydraulic conductivity. The fractal behavior of penetration depth variations with rainfall presents a good or no relation with Cl and Hl, depending on the rainfall rate and hydraulic conductivity. The topography control may be less important when rainfall rate or hydraulic conductivity is significantly reduced.},

A reservoir constructed in northeastern China was selected to analyze optimal anti-seepage designs, and numerical models have been established with visual MODflow software. The results of analyzing seepage field characteristics show that under different schemes, anti-seepage capability is controlled by the length of an anti-seepage body on the left riverbank and the depth of curtain grouting, and that seepage decreases with increasing length of the anti-seepage body and depth of the curtain grouting. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that, according to the sensitivity analysis, the permeability coefficient had different effects on the seepage gradient under incomplete and complete anti-seepage. Under incomplete anti-seepage, the seepage increased with permeability coefficient and the seepage gradient increased; and under complete anti-seepage, the seepage increased slightly with the permeability coefficient, and the seepage gradient decreased, the permeability coefficient of the anti-seepage body clearly influences the anti-seepage effects. From a project investment standpoint, complete anti-seepage on the left riverbank with a curtain grouting standard of 5 Lugeon units (Lu) is the preferred antiseepage control scheme. This scheme not only guarantees the safe operation of the dam but also ensures that seepage is less than the acceptable seepage limit, is close to the natural groundwater flow rate, and that the scheme will not significantly impact the downstream hydrogeological environment after the construction of the dam.},
